"""The console's live-update contract.

Three failure modes are silent, which is why they are tested here rather than
eyeballed: a `_page()` that stops emitting `data-live` leaves every auto-updating
view frozen with no error anywhere; a syntax error inside one of the JS blobs
embedded as a Python string simply means the script never runs — the page renders
fine and nothing in the log says otherwise; and a live page whose LATER state
introduces a `<script>` loses it to the morph (`adopt()` strips scripts out of
everything it inserts), so the markup that script was to animate arrives inert —
an un-upgraded custom element, an empty viewer div — while `data-live` disappears
in the same response, stopping the poller so it never self-heals.
