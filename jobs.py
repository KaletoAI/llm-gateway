"""Generation job store — Phase 1 of the multimodal-gateway plan.

Self-contained and dependency-free (stdlib `sqlite3` WAL + plain disk blobs),
in the spirit of stats.py. Holds the lifecycle and results of image/video/audio
generation jobs so a result stays retrievable by id for a while (TTL) even after
a synchronous caller has its inline copy.

Layout:
- metadata  → SQLite `jobs` table (status, timing, owner, result manifest)
- artifacts → `<blob_dir>/<job_id>/<n><ext>` on disk (never base64 in the DB)

A job moves queued → running → done | failed, then is pruned once it is older
than its `ttl_s`. `owner` is carried now (default "default") so Phase-3 multi-user
job-ownership checks slot in without a migration.
