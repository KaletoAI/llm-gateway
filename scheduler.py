# ── Execution-fault quarantine (per alias|backend) ─────────────────────────────
# A generation backend that ANSWERS but cannot EXECUTE is invisible to every other
# signal: discovery only calls /object_info so `backend_healthy` stays True, and the
# executor watchdog only sees a stuck queue — this one drains fine, it just turns
# every prompt into an error in three seconds. Worse, it is SELF-REINFORCING: a
# candidate that never succeeds never gets a gen_speed sample, so it keeps the
# unmeasured "probe-once" head start and wins the ordering again on the next retry
# (measured 2026-09-03: four consecutive retries all landed on the same broken box
# while two healthy ones sat idle).
#
# The signal used here is deliberately narrow: a fault counts ONLY when the same job
# then succeeded on another candidate. That is the difference between "this backend
# is broken" and "this request is broken" — without it, one bad model name would
# quarantine every backend an alias has. `main` therefore notes faults only after a
# later candidate returns artifacts, and notes NONE when they all failed alike.
