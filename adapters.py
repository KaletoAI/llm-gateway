"""Backend adapters — the pluggable per-backend protocol layer.

Phase 0 of the multimodal-gateway plan (see docs/multimodal-gateway-plan.md):
introduce the seam *without any behaviour change*. `OpenAIAdapter` is a 1:1 move
of the former module-level `proxy()` (dispatch) and the `/v1/models` discovery
helpers (`extract_models` / `extract_pricing` / …). New protocols (ComfyUI, …)
implement `BackendAdapter` and register in `ADAPTERS`.

Design notes:
- Adapters never import `main` (avoids an import cycle). Everything they need
  from the app — the in-flight counter, stats sink, pricing, log flag — is
  injected via `AdapterContext`, with hot-reloadable values read through
  callables so nothing is cached at construction time.
- The discovery helpers below are pure functions of (payload, backend dict);
  they live here because they are OpenAI-`/v1/models`-payload-specific.
